# MusicalStructureApp
This is a simple App that looks like a music player but does not include feature to actually play music, The app includes an XML file (temp.xml in assets directory) in which songs has been encoded in strings. The app imlements an XML pullParser that parses the Xml file and gets each fieild in a song, Every Field in a song is stored in an array of strings for that type, for example an array of songName... An itterator is used to iterate trough the Various arrays of strings and stores the result in an array of song type. A songAdapter adapts each song instance to be displayed on a list view. the list view shows an album art, song name, artist name, song duration. The app implements an onListItemClickListener, so when any song on the list is clicked, it shows a page to play the song. The Play song lay out includes a play button, next button, previous button, add to favourite button, a seek bar an image view etc... The play song layout shows the song name for thesong that was clicked, the artist name, the albulm art for that song, duration.
